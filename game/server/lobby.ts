// seat in one already playing — where the lobby seats it on the same socket.
// A room made for a proposal waits for its people's pages to load before its
// first match (room.ts); a backfill takes a bot's seat in a match already on.
// A hello naming a mode and an arena is seated at once instead, in the first
// open room of that mode on that arena, or a new one there (the checks, the
// load tool and the deploy's smoke test; the game never asks for that).
// One live connection per user: a direct seat lets any older one go first;
// a session takes over an older session (the ticket is the player's, not the
// tab's) and is refused while the user holds a seat. Rooms are capped; a
// room nobody has been in for `grace` is closed.
